Tech/framework used

This webpage was created using basic html, css, Javascript, moment(), jQuery and OpenWeatherMap API/Fetch.

Built with

--index.html --style.css --script.js --jQuery

How to use?

This is a simple current/weekly weath application for anyone.

When you open the application, you'll see a single input box where you will type in the city you want the current weather for as well as a five-day forecast for the next five days.

When you press enter or use the search button, the current weather will generate to the weather results container.

Underneath the current weather, you will see a five-day forecast for the city you searched.

Every time you make a search, the city will populate underneath the search input as a button.

You can click on each button generated to get the current weather and five-day forecast for the cities you have already searched instead of having to type it out again in the search input.

The application will only allow a user to save up to eight search histroy buttons, so if you enter a nineth city, it will replace the last on your history list.

If you close the browser for any reason, your last eight searched cities will still be in the search history window.

Desired additions: I'd like to add a more visually pleasing style to the page, but for a basic day-to-day planner, it's extremely clean and useful.
